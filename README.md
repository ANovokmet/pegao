  ### Pegao is a space to save and share curated pages with others.

</div>

I'm developing Pegao with Django, ReactJS and Bulma, trying to keep it simple, and hosted on Digital Ocean.

[Pegao.co](https://pegao.co) already works, but it is still in beta. So far I have built:
- Post links
- Lists
- Likes
- Followers

And the roapmap at a high level includes: 
- Account page features.
- Emoji filter.
- Bookmark search.
- Private bookmarks or private profiles.
- Follow sources and friends.
- Share links in social networks, mail.
- Page with most popular and most recent links.
- Customize interests.
- Spanish language support.
- Order links and mark them as done.
- Email notifications (possibly with Celery + Redis + Email service)
- GraphQL

...and the list keeps growing, but we will need your help to get there.

## How did I start Pegao?
I started the project a few months ago when I was looking for a bookmark where to organize all the links that remained open for a long time on my phone, easily save the new links I was finding and that I would need temporarily the next day; and also it had to be able to share some of those links with my wife without them ending up without being read...I know! There were many options but I did not feel that they were made to fulfill this purpose...and that's how I achieved my initial goal so far.

## Why Pegao?
It comes from the spanish word "pegado" and means "to be fashionable" (like the  song of the 90s), but it also refers to the crusted rice of the bottom of a cooking pot (delicious if it is not burned), and possibly in each country in Latin America has its own meaning because Pegao is something popular that belongs to people.

I translated it into English as "Paste", but if someone has a better idea ... it would be very helpful. 


## How to use...

Pasting a link is very simple, write in the address bar of the browser "pegao.co" before the link you want to share and press "Paste".

You can create your own lists —written with a / symbol— with your links to easily categorize them.
